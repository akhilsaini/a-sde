- Operator can load the items and mark the items as expired if needed, gets notified if a product goes out of stock.
- Admin can own multiple vending machines, he should have a analytics report of the items purchased in a month.
- He can also change the prices directly and it should reflect in all the vending machines which he owns.
- Exception handling in all the edge cases

##### Both HLD and LLD were expected.

##### Round 2 to 6 were done in Amazon Hyderabad campus. All interviews were back to back. It started from 11 AM to 5:30 PM with just half an hour lunch break. Before I could even step out after completing one round, other interviewers would already be waiting outside. Interviewers were very helping, but only if your are thinking in the right direction. HR also was very supportive. He was coming and motivating me after every round. Some advices here.
