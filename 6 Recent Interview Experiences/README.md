# Round 1
## Q2
- I :> Use hashing and two iteration. One iteration for copying left and right child and second iteration for pointing the random pointer with the help of hashing.
- II :> Second method is little tricky
## Q2
- I :> Devide the problem in two half smaller problems
- II :> pay special attention to float x and negative y
Note : Check the iterative approach as well and Modular exponentation
